	<p> Prepare this easy lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a
		busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> 2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish </li>
		<li> 750g lean beef mince </li>
		<li>90g pack prosciutto </li>
		<li> tomato sauce </li>
		<li> 200ml hot beef stock </li>
		<li> a little grated nutmeg </li>
		<li> 300g pack fresh lasagne sheets </li>
		<li> white sauce </li>
		<li> 125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in
			two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a
			little grated nutmeg, then season.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
		</li>
		<li>
			Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
		</li>
		<li>
			Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from
			a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
		</li>
		<li>
			Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure
			you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.
		</li>
		<li>
			Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
		</li>
		<li>
			Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and
			lightly browned.
		</li>
